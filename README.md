# Shortlinks #

Little link shortener built with [Flask][flask].

This simple app is built as an exercise for job application. I wanted to try
something new and Flask felt like suitable tool for this.

I developed and tested this app with Python 3.4, but it should work with python
2.7 as well.

## Getting started  ##

1. Create python3 virtualenv with your favorite tool.
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start development server: `./runserver.py`
4. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
